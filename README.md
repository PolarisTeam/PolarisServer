## What is it?
`Polaris Private Server` is an open source game private server for the Japanese MMORPG Phantasy Star Online 2. It is currently work-in-progress alpha, under heavy development and is not yet recommended for production use.

## Installation
As `Polaris Private Server` is a work-in-progress there is no set way of installaing and running, in future releases we hope to have this information stored in an INSTALL file. Until then you can either build or download and run the latest version.

### Building The Latest Version
For the time being, we only support using mono in order to build Polaris.
You need to have MonoDevelop 4 / Xamarin studio installed. You also need the Mono runtime, even on Windows!
After installing MD / Xamarin and setting up the Mono runtime, open the solution and build!
In the future we will hopefully have a buildserver, xbuild / msbuild support and other fancy things.

### Downloading The Latest Version
As the `Polaris Private Server` is a work-in-progress alpha, you can find the latest unstable built version here @ [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cyberkitsune/polarisserver/build/artifacts)

### Documentation
All available documentation for the server can be found on the project wiki @ [pso2proxy.cyberkitsune.net/wiki](http://pso2proxy.cyberkitsune.net/wiki)
